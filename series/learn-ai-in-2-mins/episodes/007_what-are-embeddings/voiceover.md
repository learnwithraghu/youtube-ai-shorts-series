Welcome to Learn AI in 2 Mins — quick concepts, simple metaphors, zero jargon overload.

Computers don't understand words. So how does AI grasp meaning? Embeddings.

An embedding turns a word or sentence into a list of numbers — a point in high-dimensional space. Think GPS coordinates for meaning. "King" and "Queen" land near each other. "King" and "Banana" sit far apart. The model doesn't read "happy" — it reads a vector of numbers that captures happy-ness, and compares distances to other vectors. Similar meanings cluster together. That's how search, recommendations, and RAG find relevant content — not by matching exact words, but by comparing embedding distances. Words become math. Meaning becomes geometry.

Embeddings convert text into numbers where similar meanings sit close together — that's how AI understands and searches by meaning, not spelling.

That's your concept for today. Follow for the next one — Learn AI in 2 Mins.
